# UnFollowMeLicence

Unfollow Me Licence: 0.1

I stand for what is good in the world, diversity, equality and empathy. I help where possible and care about the wellbeing of those in my communities. I will protect those that need it and do not tolerate anything less. I may not always get this right and I stand open armed and welcome criticism so I can continually improve.

I discriminate on breaking commitments, quality of work and the size of one’s ego. Nothing more.

This is an open invite to unfollow and ignore me, the signee of this license if our values are misaligned.

Where the network is healthy, great things happen. Let’s be great together.
